## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do **not** create a public issue. Instead, report it privately to the maintainers:

- Contact the repository owner directly via GitHub

Please include as much detail as possible:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes

We will respond as quickly as possible and coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline.

## Security Best Practices

- Always use the latest version of the plugin.
- Review your MyBB and server security settings regularly.
- Do not share sensitive information in public forums or issues.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a responsible disclosure process. Once a vulnerability is confirmed and patched, we will publish an advisory and credit the reporter (unless anonymity is requested).

## Credits

We appreciate responsible security researchers and users who help keep this project safe!
